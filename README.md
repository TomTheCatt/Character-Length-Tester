# Character Length Tester
A program to test the length of characters in a monitor or screen.

## Instructions
A) Download Python 3 via [Python 3's webiste](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

B) Use the command in your admin shell to download the `colorama` and `keyboard` modules:
### Pip Download
```
pip install colorama
pip install keyboard
```
C) Download the Character Length Tester file as a .zip. Open the file and run `main.py`. You can create a shortcut to it if needed.

D) Run the file from the command prompt rather than Python's IDLE shell.

## Use
Maximize your screen and use the arrow keys to add or remove characters on the screen. The default number of characters on start is 65.
Once the characters go onto another line(examples below), then one less is the maximum character limit. A counter is below.
### Not at limit
```
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
```
### At limit
```
llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
ll
```
### Exact limit
```
llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
```
